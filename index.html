		<h1>Drivers start your engines!</h1>
		<p>If you are particularly savvy you would have pressed your gas pedal shortly
		after &quot2&quot in the countdown! That's right racers, we are serious about
		having fun, fun on the track that is!</p>
		<p>From mini boosts to drifting, we love the recklessness of Mario Kart Wii. From
		the advent of this raucous racing title from Nintendo, racers young and old alike
		have engaged in some of the most haphazard go kart competition ever.</p>
		<h2>On Your Mark…</h2>
		<p>This site aims to celebrate the innocent, yet rowdy and playfully vindictive
		aspect of Mario Kart Wii. To avoid clutter and confusion (we'll leave that to the
		racing) we focus on three areas of gameplay:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><h3>Character Faves</h3></li>
			<li><h3>Course Faves</h3></li>
			<li><h3>Competition</h3></li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Get Set…</h2>
		<p>This is where the familiar avatars shine! Everyone from the sweet looking
		princesses to the  strangely cute, fantastical racers are profiled along with their
		vehicle options.</p>
		<h3>Characters</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Mario</li>
			<li>Luigi</li>
			<li>Toad</li>
			<li>Yoshi</li>
			<li>Princess Peach</li>
			<li>Baby Mario</li>
			<li>Baby Luigi</li>
			<li>Wario</li>
			<li>Waluigi</li>
		</ul>
