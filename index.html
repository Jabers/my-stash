		<p>If you are particularly savvy you would have pressed your gas pedal shortly
		after &quot;2&quot; in the countdown! That's right racers, we are serious about
		having fun, fun on the track that is!</p>
		<p>From mini boosts to drifting, we love the recklessness of Mario Kart Wii. From
		the advent of this raucous racing title from Nintendo, racers young and old alike
		have engaged in some of the most haphazard go kart competition ever.</p>
		<p>This is just a fan site, visit their wiki-page for a more thorough look at Mario
		Kart on all platforms <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Kart">here</a>.</p>

			<h2>On Your Mark…</h2>
				<p>This site aims to celebrate the innocent, yet rowdy and playfully vindictive
				aspect of Mario Kart Wii. To avoid clutter and confusion (we'll leave that to
				the racing) we focus on three areas of gameplay:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><h3>Character Faves</h3></li>
				<li><h3>Course Faves</h3></li>
				<li><h3>Competition</h3></li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<div id="middle_main">
			<h2>Get Set…</h2>
				<p>This is where the familiar avatars shine! Everyone from the sweet
				looking princesses to the  strangely cute, fantastical racers are profiled
				along with their vehicle options.</p>
			<h3>Character Gallery</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Mario</li>
					<li>Luigi</li>
					<li>Toad</li>
					<li>Yoshi</li>
					<li>Princess Peach</li>
					<li>Baby Mario</li>
					<li>Baby Luigi</li>
					<li>Wario</li>
					<li>Waluigi</li>
				</ul>
		</div>
		<div id="bottom_main">
			<h2>GO!</h2>
				<p>Proof positive, that's what we want! There's nothing like a screen-capture
				of gamers in the throes of high-speed competition. We have shots of bomb
				drops, peel placing, red and green turtle shells zinging by, and so much
				more-even the occasional cliff dive or mushroom missing bounce! We feature
				our favorite shot-of-the-week and by years end we award someone with a
				shot-of-the-year trophy!</p>
