				<p><strong>If you are particularly savvy</strong> you would have pressed
				your gas pedal shortly after &quot;2&quot; in the countdown! That's right
				racers, we are serious about having fun, fun in a sort of sadistic, beam
				your enemy with a turtle shell way that is!</p>
				<p>From mini boosts to drifting, we love the recklessness of Mario Kart
				Wii. From the advent of this raucous racing title from Nintendo, racers
				young and old alike have engaged in some of the most haphazard go kart
				competition ever.</p>
				<p>This is just a fan site, visit their wiki-page for a more thorough look

					<p><strong>This site</strong> aims to celebrate the innocent, yet
					rowdy and playfully vindictive aspect of Mario Kart Wii. To avoid
					clutter and confusion(we'll leave that to the racing) we focus on
					three areas of gameplay:</p>
				<div id="categories"><ol>
					<li><h3>Character Faves</h3></li>
					<p>We have our own race time avatar. Some like the main guys, others
					live vicariously through their evil alter egos like Waluigi. We
					highlight some perennial faves as well as dark horses. Perhaps you may
					change your mind about who your favorite really is!</P
					<li><h3>Course Faves</h3></li>
					<p>Each character has a course(s) that they should shine on. The truth
					is, each course has different playability as the settings are tweaked.
					For example, one advantaged racer on a particular course loses their
					edge when the item style is altered (curse you first place turtle
					shell!).</p>
					<li><h3>Competition</h3></li>
					<p>Their are tips and tricks to beating out the other racers, albeit
					few and fairly well known. However, competition still has a lure that
					is difficult to ignore, especially when your five year old is kicking
					booty chaw - your booty, that is!</p>

					<p><strong>Proof positive</strong>, that's what we want! There's
					nothing like a screen-capture of gamers in the throes of high-speed
					competition. We have shots of bomb drops, peel placing, red and green
					turtle shells zinging by, and so much more-even the occasional cliff
					dive or mushroom missing bounce! We feature our favorite
					shot-of-the-week and by years end we award someone with a
					shot-of-the-year trophy!</p>
